Not only better in terms of its implementation, but also its legibility compared to
the nonsense found here:

Given a pattern, and an input string, give all the indices after which the pattern can
be found.

Example:
    Given input_string = "ABBCDDBCE", pattern = "BC",
    Because input_string[2:4] == input_string[6,8]
    return 2,6
