# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing. Due to the relatively simple nature of the project, the main focus is on code quality and exposition. It's a great project for your first contribution.

## Appreciated Contributions
- Adding a new algorithm or data structure implementation
- Improving an existing algorithm or data structure
    - Better implementation (fewer loc, less complexity, etc.)
    - Using more appropriate variable names
- Improving problem and alogorithm descriptions
- Reorganizing algorithms into more appropriate locations


## Reporting Issues
Report bugs using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/benburk/dsa_python/issues). If an algorithm or data structure isn't working as expected, include the test case.
